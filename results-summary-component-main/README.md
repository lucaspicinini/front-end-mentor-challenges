### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Media Query
- BEM methodology in the construction of CSS. 

### What I learned

I started learning web development just 1 month ago, so keep in mind that I'm quite a beginner. I'm focusing on learning the basics and I tried to apply the BEM methodology in the construction of CSS, it seemed the simplest to apply for a beginner and I hope it turned out good. If you are more experienced and have any tips to give me, don't hesitate to send me a message, I love to learn.

### Continued development

I intend to train the markup languages until I feel minimally confident in doing something by myself and then I'll start learning JavaScript. I'm Brazilian and I've always been passionate about computing, but I only had access to the internet at friends or relatives' houses, I only had the opportunity to have my own computer and time to learn coding this year. I'm 31 years old and now I can finally follow this dream of working with programming.

### Useful resources

I am self-taught and I learn most things through W3Schools or freecodecamp.org
