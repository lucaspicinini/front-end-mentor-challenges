### What I learned

I started learning web development just 2 month ago, so keep in mind that I'm quite a beginner. This was my first project in JavaScript and I learned a lot about the DOM.

### Continued development

I'm Brazilian and I've always been passionate about computing, but I only had access to the internet at friends or relatives' houses, I only had the opportunity to have my own computer and time to learn coding this year. I'm 31 years old and now I can finally follow this dream of working with programming.
